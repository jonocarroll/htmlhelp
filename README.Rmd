# htmlhelp: Fancier R help files

Some experiments in using raw HTML in R help files.  Basically, raw HTML can
be placed inside `\html{}` macros in `.Rd` files and **roxygen2** comments.

To see an example, install via `devtools::install_github('noamross/htmlhelp')` and
run `?hello`.

See `man/macros/macros.Rd` and `R/macros.R` for how it works.

Assets to be used in the HTML should be placed in the `inst/doc` directory.  When
referring to these files, start the path with `../doc/` like so: `<img src="../doc/myfile.png">`.

Right now the raw HTML shows up in other help file formats. You may want
to use the `\if{html}` macro to avoid this.

I'm not sure where this will lead. It emerged out a discussion of how to get feedback
on documentation, so the thought was to put a feedback form at the bottom of help
files.  One could also include images, such as example plots (Ã  la [**staticdocs**](https://github.com/hadley/staticdocs)).

There are definitely limitations to R help's httpd server.  I found I could
not embed iframes with external sources, nor was I able to submit a form to google forms.
The latter could use some experimentation if one is to use this tool to gather
feedback on documentation.

Please fork, PR, comment in the issues, do whatever you want with this, etc.  I'd love to see your experiments

Oh, when working on this it may be useful to turn on RStudio's debugger mode,
which allows one to inspect elements by right-clicking, like a browser developer mode.
To do this on OSX, use

    defaults write org.rstudio.RStudio WebKitDeveloperExtras -bool true
    
I'm not sure how to activate it on other systems.
